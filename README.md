# RubberDuck Forked
Forked version of [salvadormg15's Rubber Duck Mod](https://github.com/salvadormg15/Rubber-Duck) maintained for newer verison of Minecraft (1.20+)
<br>
<br>
At time I'm writing this, the official RubberDuck mod and RubberDuck ReHatched hasn't been updated since a year so I decided to make this fork.

### 1.21 State
I'm waiting for 1.21 to stabilize before updating the mod to this version

### Looking for 1.19 ?
Check out [Rubber Duck ReHatched](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/rubber-duck-rehatched)

#
This mod just adds an usable Rubber duck.
It receives/gives redstone signal when using it, so you can use it for circuits.

The duck spawns in zombies and skeletons with a low probability. It can also be obtainable in dungeon chests.

I hope you enjoy it!
